## I haven't learned anything up to know, is there any way to learn SQL overnight?

Not really, but [this](https://github.com/tthibo/SQL-Tutorial) may help.

## Why MySQL doesn't let me delete my records?

It is a safety measure, and a non-standard behavior. But you can make it comply by going to MySQLWorkbench | Preferences | SQL Editor and then unchecking "Forbid UPDATEs and DELETEs with no key in WHERE clause or no LIMIT clause."

## Do I need to surround every object name with backticks in MySQL?

No, only if you have used unconventional characters in your naming.

## Single quotes or double quotes?

Whatever works. Single quotes if you are in doubt or if double quotes don't work.
