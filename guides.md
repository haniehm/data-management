## Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) is the default solution we will use to get access to database servers for the course. If you haven't set it up yet, please contact me or Hanieh to set an appointment ASAP. Alternatively, [here is a guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/heroku/) for setting it up (or finding your database password if you have lost it).

## Amazon Web Services

If you need to set up [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com) for your final project (free, with more resources than Heroku, including possibility of multiple users), please contact me directly.

## Local MySQL Server

You also have the option of [installing an instance of MySQL server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) locally on your computer. Unfortunately we can not support you much on that, but if you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask.
