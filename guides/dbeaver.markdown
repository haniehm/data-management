# Setting up dbeaver on your computer

First download dbeaver Enterprise Edition from [its website](http://dbeaver.jkiss.org/download/). Depending on the file you have downloaded, you may have to decompress the file or run the installer.

dbeaver needs Java runtime to function properly, so you may need to install Java as well. You can get
 a copy of Java Runtime Edition from [its website](http://java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp?locale=en).

In order to run dbeaver on a Mac machine, you need to right click the executable file and click "open". If you are encountering the dialog below, you need to install Java:

![Import CSV Recordset]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/java.png)

Click on "More Info..." and a browser windo will open. Now here is the tricky part. If your default browser is Chrome, you will get access to the appropriate version of Java you need for this purpose. If your default browser is Safari, nothing will happen. You will need to copy the address shown in Safari and paste it in Chrome, so that the software install starts (Thanks Baptiste for the tip).
