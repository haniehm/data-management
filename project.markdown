## Description

This is a semester-long team-based project. You will work in a team of four or five to solve a semi-structured analytic issue, from data gathering to reporting. You will be given a project description containing a number of open ended questions that require a data-driven, analytic approach to answer. The project description will also point you to two data sources that you will have to build on in your analysis. You will be asked to:

- Structure the problem and propose a roadmap for your project (1st deliverable)
- Identify at least one additional data source that you can merge with the two given data sources (1st deliverable)
- Demonstrate that you have successfully cleaned and imported your data in a database (2nd deliverable)
- Carry out your data transformation and analysis plan, according to your roadmap, and present the results (3rd deliverable)
- Explain in a final report the stages you went through and the way you arrived at your results (4th deliverable)

You will be asked to take on a specific role within your team. You will be assessed by your success in your responsibilities and your team's general success in the project.

## Roles

Leader
: Manages the team and synchronizes member activities. The leader is proactive and makes sure the team is making due progress. The leader also resolves conflicts between members and makes sure the work of individual members is consolidated into a whole. The leader will have an even working charge throughout the trimester.

DB Admin
: Is the person who makes sure the data is harvested, cleaned, imported and prepared within due time for analysis and visualization. Every team member is supposed to contribute to the data stage, but the admin is the person who takes the responsibility of this stage and has the final say on what is included or excluded from the dataset. The admin role is a head-heavy role, as the bulk of the data stage happens at the beginning of the project.

Analyst
: Takes the responsibility of the data analysis stage of the project. The analyst is not the only person who does the analysis, but is the person who is held responsible for the analytics and will have the final say on it. The analyst role is a tail-heavy role: The real analysis starts only when the data is ready.

Visualizer
: Works closely with the analyst and takes the responsibility of the visual representation of the outcomes. The visualizer is not the only person who contributes visualizations, but is the person who is held responsible for the quality of the visual outcomes and will have the final say on them. The visualizer role is a tail-heavy role: The real visualization starts only when the data is ready.

Reporter
: Works closely with the leader to make sure the team's reports and presentations are presented as a coherent whole and in a timely manner. The reporter is not supposed to do the whole writeup instead of the other team members, but is the one who orchestrates the reporting, does the quality assurance, and consolidates the reports. The reporter's role is also tail-heavy: Most of the deliverables of the project are due at the end of the semester.
