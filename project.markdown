## Description

This is a semester-long team-based project. You will work in a team of four or five to solve a semi-structured analytic issue, from data gathering to reporting. 

- Session 4: Description of four different project themes will be provided to students. Each project theme explains a debate between two opposing perspectives (4 themes X 2 perspectives = 8 projects) and includes two datasources that are obligatory to deploy. Students will be allocated to teams of 4 or 5 members based on their preferences for the theme and existing restrictions. The perspective of each team will be determined after the formation of teams and by a quick voting during session 6.

- Session 5: Students can start sharing their project preferences through the

 To determine their preferences for the theme students may also want to go through the existing open data sources ( some introduced in session 3 )

- Session 6: Team compositions will be finalized during this session and members can start to intensively discuss and analyze  other datasources that they will use for the project after this session.

- Session 8 (8% of the final grade): By this session teams are to submit a one-page long but precise explanation of their approach and additional datasources for the projects. Each team should explain how it finds the proposed additional datasource(s) relevant for the project and how can all the project datasources be used and related.

- Session 11 (8% of the final grade): By this session teams are to finish data cleaning and data transformation and to import the data to the database server. Teams are to submit a one-page document explaining the data cleaning, transformation and importation procedure and to present it during this session.

- Session 20 (8% of the final grade): By this session teams are to submit a two-page progress report which shows the gradual application of the concepts learned during the practical sessions to the project.

- Session 24: This session will be an opportunity for teams to demonstrate their performance and mastery of their analytical skills.

- Session 25 and 26 (8% of the final grade): During these sessions teams are to present the finalized analysis and visualizations that will support their specific perspectives on each theme.

-  Final project documentation (13% of the final project grade) submission deadline:TBA
