## I need more practice!

The Watson book has [a nice companion website](http://richardtwatson.com/dm6e/) with numerous examples and additional exercises.

## Can I use the 5th edition of Watson's book that is available as an ebook in the library?

_Mahmood:_ I can't say I have extensively researched the differences between the two editions, but I have had a look at the 5th edition and at least on the surface it does not seem to have any significant difference with the 6th edition, particularly with regard to what we cover. But unfortunately I canâ€™t guaranty that no part of the chapters has been updated. If you intend to use the 5th edition, at least make sure you have verified the order and the topic of the chapters in each version and their eventual differences. [Here is the TOC of the 6th edition](http://richardtwatson.com/dm6e/Reader/contents.html).

## I have missed some sessions and I need to learn what has been taught. Is there any resource you would recommend?

There is an excellent [online SQL course offered by CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql) that takes you through almost all you need step by step. It will take you about three hours to complete it.

## As a part of my project I need some advanced SQL/PostgreSQL features not covered in the class. How can I learn about them?

_Mahmood:_ There is a free [PostgreSQL Tutorial on TutorialsPoint](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/) that even I use from time to time. Give it a try, and if you can't get it to work come by to see me at my office time.

## Is there any good SQL command reference you recommend?

_Mahmood:_ There are many good ones, but almost all of them exclusively cover standard-based SQL. If you want a quick reference for everyday use, you can find one on [1keydata.com](http://www.1keydata.com/sql/sql.html).

## How can I generate some test data to play with?

Have a look at [generatedata.com](http://www.generatedata.com) as well as [mockaroo.com](http://www.mockaroo.com).

## Where can I get some open data for the project?

- http://www.donnees.gouv.qc.ca
