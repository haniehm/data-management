## Course Objectives

This course is designed to provide a first hands-on experience with databases as well as a general understanding of data management concepts for B.Com. student completing the concentration/major in Information Systems or interested in data and data management. This course is open to students in their 3rd year. It will count towards the IS concentration or major. It is also open to MBA students in their 2nd year completing an IS concentration or an additional course to enhance their IT knowledge in the workplace. This course does not assume any specific technical background or programming skill, but it comprises a strong technical component and requires a willingness to invest in technical skills. This course is not a substitute for database design and development courses offered in computer science departments.

## ￼￼Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of data storage, retrieval and transformation
- Recognize the latest trends in data storage and database use
- Apply modeling techniques to design a database
- Identify the advantages and disadvantages of different storage models (Relational, NoSQL, etc.)
- Use SQL for data definition (DDL) and data manipulation (DML) purposes
- Use a database server (MySQL)
- Design a relational database using Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
- Design a CRUD or reporting interface for a pre-existing relational database
- Use the modern cloud-based app deployment platforms
- Work as a team and in a distributed manner on a database or a database application project
- Analyze the data life cycle in organizations
- Examine how data enables new business models
- Conceptualize the increasing importance of data privacy and information security for citizens and corporations
- Understand the new trends in big data, data science, data-enabled decision making and predictive analytics
- Understand the new trends in open data and release of public data Materials
We will be using a variety of online articles and selected chapters from three textbooks that offer different perspectives on the topics covered:

## References

- Data Management by Richard Watson, 6th Edition (Amazon - Kindle Edition)
- The Data Revolution by Rob Kitchin (Amazon - Kindle Edition)
- A number of additional book chapters and articles from scientific journals and the press

Additional resources:

- MySQL Cookbook by Paul Dubois, 3rd Edition (Safari Books Online)
- SQL for Dummies by Allen G. Taylor (Safari Books Online)
- Any online SQL tutorial (e.g. 1keydata, w3c school)
￼￼
## Software

- MySQLWorkbench (Oracle)
- LibreOffice (The Document Foundation)
- dbeaver Enterprise Edition (JKISS)￼

## Online Resources

We will be using a relational database for documents (slides, assignments, etc.), announcements, class discussion and grades. We will be using several websites (e.g. Heroku) for data hosting and data retrieval as well.

## ￼￼Grading and Evaluation

| __Activity__                 | __G__ |
|------------------------------|:-----:|
| Final project (team)         |  40%  |
| 2 Quizzes                    |  30%  |
| 2 Exercises (individual)     |  20%  |
| Attendance and Participation |  10%  |

## Final project

￼In groups of 4 or 5 members, students will work on a project of their choice. The project will consist of working on an open dataset (e.g. Open Data from The City of Montreal) or developing a database application.

Project deliverables:
    - One-page description of the project (contractual)
    - One-page progress report
    - The actual software produced (database, database application, visualization, pivot table, etc...)
    - Project presentation
    - Project documentation (instruction manual, help files, in-line code comments, etc...)

The two workshop sessions (Kickstart session and Capstone session) will also be an opportunity for you to demonstrate your performance and mastery of your project.

## Quizzes

These quizzes will cover all the material not covered in the take-home exercises (see below). This includes non-technical compulsory readings, material discussed during the class and eventual presentations by classmates or guest speakers. If you have attended and actively participated in class discussion, these should be quite straightforward. The quizzes will take about 45 minutes of the class period and will be composed of a few short essay questions.

The quiz questions are crowdsourced. Each student will contribute one or two questions to each quiz. Subsequently the questions will be curated and published online. The curated list will be your only reference for the quiz.

## Exercises

The two take-home exercises cover the technical content of the course, including design principles, SQL codes and concepts. The exercises are designed to assess your practical, rather than theoretical, understanding of the database concepts and techniques. They may require you to prepare SQL files to resolve a problem, create actual databases, run actual queries over datasets or design databases.

## Attendance/Participation

Please e-mail me before class if you will be missing a session. If you miss more than two classes, your participation grade will drop. However, being in class is not sufficient for receiving full participation points. Be active and contribute to class discussion!

## Course Schedule

Course schedule will be shared with you on the first day of the class. One session over two will be in form of a workshop and will cover technical material. Each session requires you to read one or two texts. For some topics you will also have some news articles to skim in order to warm up the class discussion. We will kickstart the final project on Feb. 24 with a final delivery date of Apr. 10.

## University Policies

1. "McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore, all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/ for more information) "L'université McGill attache une haute importance à l’honnêteté académique. Il incombe par conséquent à tous les étudiants de comprendre ce que l'on entend par tricherie, plagiat et autres infractions académiques, ainsi que les conséquences que peuvent avoir de telles actions, selon le Code de conduite de l'étudiant et des procédures disciplinaires (pour de plus amples renseignements, veuillez consulter le site www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/ )."

2. “In accord with McGill University’s Charter of Students’ Rights, students in this course have the right to submit in English or in French any written work that is to be graded.” (approved by Senate on 21 January 2009 - see also the section in this document on Assignments and evaluation.)
"Conformément à la Charte des droits de l’étudiant de l’Université McGill, chaque étudiant a le droit de soumettre en français ou en anglais tout travail écrit devant être noté (sauf dans le cas des cours dont l’un des objets est la maîtrise d’une langue)."
