# Preparation for Exercise 3 (Graded)

The mission of the second graded exercise (Exercise 3) is simple: To make sure you know how to design a database according to the design principles you have studied, you know how to create the data structure you have designed, and you know how to import your data in it. As you can imagine, the emphais here is on DDL rather than DML. In order to get ready, make sure you have studied the 7th and the 8th chapters of Watson. Also make sure you remember the DDL commands such as `CREATE TABLE`. 

If you want to do some exercise, you can use Watson's skill builders:

Once you design the database the way he describes, you can try to write down the script to actually create the database, or even import some data.
